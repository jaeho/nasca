# Nasca

Nasca is a high resolution image loading library using WebView for Android that enables less memory usage, faster loading, caching, and easier callbacks.

Nasca supports loading and displaying various types of images from networks that contain animated gifs and webp. Nasca includes a lite API that using your own WebView as ImageView. Nascaâ€™s primary focus is to guarantee scrolling HUGE size images as smooth as possible without using too much app memory.

Download
-
You can use Gradle like this:

```
repositories {
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.myrealtrip:nasca:$version'
}
```

How do I use Nasca?
-
Check out the [sample app source code](/sample_app/src/main/java/com/mrt/nasca/sample) for the example.

Simple use cases will look something like this:

```
nascaView.loadImages(
    "https://github.com/comprohyo/images/blob/master/image5.jpg?raw=true",
    "https://github.com/comprohyo/images/blob/master/image7.jpg?raw=true"
)
```

Or this is also possible through using layout-xml.
```
<com.mrt.nasca.NascaView
    android:id="@+id/nasca"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"    
    app:nasca_zoomable="true"
    app:nasca_src="https://github.com/comprohyo/images/blob/master/image5.jpg?raw=true"
/>
```

If you need callback for click, progress, errors.
```
nascaView.listener = object : NascaViewListener() {
    override fun onImageClicked(index: Int, url: String) {
        super.onImageClicked(index, url)
        Log.d("onImageClicked", "$index $url")
    }

    override fun onProgressChanged(progress: Int) {
        super.onProgressChanged(progress)
        Log.d("onProgressChanged", "$progress")
    }

    override fun onLoadingFailed(url: String, errorCode: Int, errorMsg: CharSequence?) {
        super.onLoadingFailed(url, errorCode, errorMsg)
        Log.d("onLoadingFailed", "$errorMsg $url")
    }
}
```

Or Use your own WebView as ImageView (Kotlin Only)
```
webView.nascaImageLoads(
    false, 
    "https://github.com/comprohyo/images/blob/master/image5.jpg?raw=true",
    "https://github.com/comprohyo/images/blob/master/image7.jpg?raw=true"
)
```
